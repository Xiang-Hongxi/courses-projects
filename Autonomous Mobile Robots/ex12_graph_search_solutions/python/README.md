# Dijkstra / A* exercise
The exercise version handed out to the student can be found in the [`exercise_handout`](./exercise_handout) folder. The solution is provided in the [`solution`](./solution) folder.
Additionally, to generate new graphs you can adapt and run the [`tools/create_random_graph.py`](./tools/create_random_graph.py) script. The latter requires additional dependencies, which you may install in your virtualenv with:
```bash
pip install matplotlib~=3.5.1 networkx~=2.7.1
```
